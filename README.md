# F1FanApp!

Hey! It's app that shows current leaderboard for F1 driver strandings, and shows incoming races.
Also you can preview drivers and you can see basic info about them. In the future I'm planning on adding widget that will show next race.
And availability to add race into calendar.
Short showcase (date doesn't match with this in view because I recorded it after season):
